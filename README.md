System for commodity producers.
Production data is taken from a production line equipped with DataMatrix scanners and compared with a dataset from "Честный знак".
Based on the data obtained, we make a forecast for the production: plant and production in the region of presence. All information is transferred to a report based on 1C, where it is stored in the appropriate registers. Based on this report, the decision maker can look at the number of products produced, the number of products produced in the region of interest, and their market share. Already on the basis of this report, he will be able to predict the need for purchases, expand or reduce production, adopt investment programs, etc. Those. perform their work more quickly and clearly, up to the concept of Just-In-Time.
